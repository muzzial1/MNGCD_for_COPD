## An integrative network-based approach to identify driving gene communities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Supplementary repository to collect the set of scritps to analyze by a multi-layer network gene community detection (MNGCD) method, based on the partition of maps of information algorithm (Infomap), to identify subnetworks of strongly interacting genes ('gene communitiesâ€™), which were then characterized for enrichment with annotated biological functions or sets of regulons. The analysis was applied to identify driving gene communities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

#### Scripts execution flow
The execution environment is a Unix HPC with slurm parallel execution queue manager, Infomap and R are required. Here we report a description of the executed code to run Infomap and the enrichment analysis of the identified gene communities (scripts avalailable). 
/**
1. Run the following bash scripts in the following order after changing in each script the line for j in (ls -1d output_*vero)  replacing the term output_*vero with the name of the file to analyse:
* ./execallt.sh generates 100 partitions using Infomap:
  - it executes perparcopy2.sh, which in turn runs stability_sb2.R 20 times in parallel.
  - stability_sb2.R calls myscript_varifile_copy_cal.sh, which executes Infomap 100 times with different seeds for each iteration.
  - Seeds also vary across the 20 invocations of perparcopy2.sh.
* ./execallt_cons.sh calculates the consensus on the 100 partitions:
  - It executes perparconsensi_v2.sh, which runs stabilityperconsenso_v2.R 20 times in parallel.
  - stabilityperconsenso_v2.R calculates the consensus as follows:
  - A for loop is executed, starting with the 100 partitions generated by Infomap.
  - In each iteration, generoperconsenso_cal.sh is called.
  - The process continues until all generated partitions are identical, producing the consensus matrix.
* ./execallt_arr.sh  (with argument h or c3 or c5 or BTM, depending on the gene-set collection to use for the enrichment of communities)
* ./execallt_pval.sh  (with argument h or c3 or c5 or BTM, depending on the gene-set collection to use for the enrichment of communities)
* ./alltabs.sh (with argument h or c3 or c5 or BTM, depending on the gene-set collection to use for the enrichment of communities)

2. In the folder  final_result in the folder prova_nmi/output_nameofthemultinetwork   there is the final result (functions enriched in each community with their rate) for the gene set collection selected.
